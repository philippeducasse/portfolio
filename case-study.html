                        Fletnix is a single page web app, developed using the MERN stack. The app provides users with
                        access to
                        a
                        small
                        library of movies, where each entry is composed of an image
                        and information about movies,
                        directors, and genres. Users are
                        able to create an account,
                        browse through the library,
                        update their personal data,
                        and create a list of favourite
                        movies.

                    <p class="objective-text">
                        The aim of the project was to
                        create an entire web application,
                        including the API, the database,
                        and the front-end from scratch.
                        This gave me a hands-on
                        understanding of how web
                        applications work and how each
                        component interacts with the
                        others.

                    <p class="approach-text">
                        I created a RESTful API using Node.js and
                        Express, that interacts with a
                        non-relational database (MongoDB). The
                        API can be accessed via the CRUD (Create,
                        Read, Update, Delete) HTTP methods like
                        GET or POST, and returns information in
                        JSON format. In addition, I implemented
                        server side authentication and
                        authorisation using HTTP authentication
                        and tokens through the Express library
                        Passport. All of these endpoints were
                        thoroughly tested using Postman, and
                        once functional the database was hosted
                        on Mongo Atlas, and the API was hosted
                        with Heroku.

            <h2 class="cs-title">Client-Side</h2>
            <p>
                Once the backend was ready, I started to build the platform on which users would
                be able to interact with the API. Fletnix is a single-page application (SPA),
                developed with React. By making the app an SPA, I had to rely on React
                components and state in order to navigate the user through the various
                interfaces the site offers. Users can thus sign-up, login, browse movies, view and
                update their profile, add and remove movies to a list of favourites; all within a
                single html file.

                        The most challenging part of this
                        project for me was the front end
                        with React. I found it extremely
                        confusing at first and it was
                        especially difficult for me to
                        understand how React props and
                        state work. In order to
                        understand the framework
                        better, I built two or three
                        smaller, much simpler applications. With regards to the back-end, getting the
                        endpoints to work properly was also quite challenging.

                        The Fletnix project provides
                        users with a fully functional,
                        custom made application. This
                        project was by far the most
                        ambitious I have yet
                        undertaken on my journey in
                        web development. Even though
                        this project was quite large for a
                        single programmer to
                        undertake, it must be
                        recognised that the
                        functionalities are still quite
                        limited. This leaves room for
                        improvement: perhaps future versions of the film can allow users to enter their
                        own movies to the database, and add additional features, such as reviews and
                        rankings? In any case, the experience and knowledge I gained from this project
                        were invaluable, and I look forward to what comes next in my career as a
                        developer.
